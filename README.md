# GABSE
This is the GABSE (Generic Agent-Based Simulation for Engineering) framework.  It provides classes and methods to create and manage simulations involving agents, their actions, sensors, and the simulation context. It is based on agent-based modeling technique and is developed with the intention of being lightweight, scalable, and flexible. This package provides the engine, action scheduling, generic agent functionality, and sensory data collection and management tools.

EXAMPLES:
    - Zombie apocalypse (both 2D and 3D)

REQUIRED packages:
    - sortedcontainers
    - numpy
    - copy
